# URL_Shortener Project Workflow
1. Users can enter the URL they want to shorten. After entering a URL, click on the ‘Shorten’ URL button to display the shortened URL in the following text-field which can be copied by clicking on the copy button.
2. After the ‘Shorten’ button is clicked, the URL that is entered is saved in our database with the shortened URL. It is saved in the database so that the user can look into the previous URLs he entered in our web-app with their shortened URL.
3. Try to verify the URL entered by the user is correct or not. (Do some googling to find out how to make it possible)
